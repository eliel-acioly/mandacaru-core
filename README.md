🌵 Manifesto — A Alma do Projeto

This project was not created in a comfortable office.

It was forged under the sun of the Brazilian northeast.

Developed in
Arapiraca — Agreste Alagoano

Between:

Hard daily work

Real life struggles

And late-night coding sessions


Like the Mandacaru cactus:

It grows where nothing else survives.

There may be no luxury in its origin.

But there is strength.

There is resilience.

There is vision.

The sun does not dry its ideas.
The struggle does not stop its progress.

Each line of code is a step toward freedom.

👨‍💻 Author

Built by a self-taught developer from Brazil’s semi-arid region, proving that:
